# ICJIA Simple Webpack Example

Basic walkthrough of how Webpack bundles javascript and generates a build directory. This is loosely based on the Webpack 2 *Getting Started* example: [https://webpack.js.org/get-started/](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/).

The workflow below reflects the basic workflow for ICJIA's recent websites.

## Build Setup

``` bash

# clone project
git clone https://github.com/ICJIA/icjia-simple-webpack-example.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build


# build for production and serve locally
npm run build:serve

```

## Running build process ```npm run build```:
