# ICJIA Simple Webpack Example

Basic walkthrough of how Webpack bundles javascript and generates a build directory. This is loosely based on the Webpack 2 *Getting Started* example: (https://webpack.js.org/get-started/)[https://webpack.js.org/get-started/]

## Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run development server

```
npm run dev
```

## Serve the built files from the ```./dist``` directory

```
npm run serve
```
